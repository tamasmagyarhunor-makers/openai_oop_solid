# Here is an example of the Liskov Substitution Principle in Ruby using the Car class from the previous examples:

# define a class for a car
class Car
    # define an initialize method to set the starting values for the car's attributes
    def initialize(make, model, year)
      @make = make
      @model = model
      @year = year
    end
  
    # define methods to retrieve the car's make, model, and year
    def get_make
      @make
    end
  
    def get_model
      @model
    end
  
    def get_year
      @year
    end
  end
  
  # define a class for a sports car that inherits from the Car class
  class SportsCar < Car
    # define an initialize method to set the starting values for the sports car's attributes
    def initialize(make, model, year, horsepower)
      # call the initialize method of the parent class to set the make, model, and year attributes
      super(make, model, year)
      @horsepower = horsepower
    end
  
    # define a method to retrieve the sports car's horsepower
    def get_horsepower
      @horsepower
    end
  end
  
  # define a method that takes a car as an argument and prints its make, model, and year
  def print_car_info(car)
    puts car.get_make
    puts car.get_model
    puts car.get_year
  end
  
  # create an instance of the SportsCar class
  my_car = SportsCar.new("Ford", "Mustang", 1968, 400)
  
  # use the print_car_info method to print the make, model, and year of the car
  print_car_info(my_car)

#   In this code, the SportsCar class is a subclass of the Car class. This means that it inherits all of the characteristics of the Car class, such as the initialize and get_make, get_model, and get_year methods. The SportsCar class then defines its own initialize method and get_horsepower method, which provide additional functionality that is specific to sports cars.

# The print_car_info method takes a Car object as an argument and prints its make, model, and year. This method is designed to work with any object that has the same characteristics and behavior as a Car object. Because the SportsCar class is a substitution for the Car class, it can be used in place of a Car object without causing errors or unexpected behavior. When we pass the my_car object to the print_car_info method, it is able to print the make, model, and year of the sports car, even though the sports car has additional attributes and behavior that are not used by the print_car_info method.
