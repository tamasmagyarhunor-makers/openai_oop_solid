# Here is an example of the Dependency Inversion Principle in Ruby using the Car class from the previous examples:

# define an interface for a vehicle
module Vehicle
    def get_make
      raise NotImplementedError, "get_make must be implemented by a subclass"
    end
  
    def get_model
      raise NotImplementedError, "get_model must be implemented by a subclass"
    end
  
    def get_year
      raise NotImplementedError, "get_year must be implemented by a subclass"
    end
  end
  
  # define a class for a car that implements the Vehicle interface
  class Car
    include Vehicle
  
    # define an initialize method to set the starting values for the car's attributes
    def initialize(make, model, year)
      @make = make
      @model = model
      @year = year
    end
  
    # implement the get_make, get_model, and get_year methods of the Vehicle interface
    def get_make
      @make
    end
  
    def get_model
      @model
    end
  
    def get_year
      @year
    end
  end
  
  # define a class for a car printer
  class CarPrinter
    # define an initialize method to set the starting values for the car printer's attributes
    def initialize(car)
      @car = car
    end
  
    # define a method to print the make, model, and year of the car
    def print_car
      puts @car.get_make
      puts @car.get_model
      puts @car.get_year
    end
  end
  
  # create an instance of the Car class
  my_car = Car.new("Ford", "Mustang", 1968)
  
  # create an instance of the CarPrinter class and pass the my_car object as an argument
  my_car_printer = CarPrinter.new(my_car)
  
  # use the CarPrinter object to print the make, model, and year of the car
  my_car_printer.print_car

  
#   Here is a rewritten explanation of the code example for the Dependency Inversion Principle:

# The code defines a Vehicle interface and a Car class that implements the Vehicle interface. The Vehicle interface defines three methods: get_make, get_model, and get_year, which are used to retrieve the make, model, and year of a vehicle. The Car class defines its own initialize method to set the starting values for its attributes, and implements the get_make, get_model, and get_year methods of the Vehicle interface. This allows the Car class to have the same characteristics and behavior as a Vehicle, and to be used in the same way by other classes or methods that expect a Vehicle object.

# The code also defines a CarPrinter class, which is used to print the make, model, and year of a car. The CarPrinter class depends on the Car class to provide the information that it needs to print, but it does not depend on the specific implementation of the Car class. Instead, it depends on the Vehicle interface that the Car class implements. This means that the CarPrinter class can work with any object that has the same characteristics and behavior as a Car object, without knowing or caring about the specific implementation of the object.

# When we create an instance of the Car class and pass it to the CarPrinter class, the CarPrinter class is able to use the get_make, get_model, and get_year methods of the Vehicle interface to print the make, model, and year of the car. This demonstrates the Dependency Inversion Principle, because the CarPrinter class depends on the Vehicle interface, and not on the specific implementation of the Car class. This makes the code more flexible, maintainable, and testable, and allows the application to support different types of vehicles without breaking the Dependency Inversion Principle.
