# Here is an example of the Interface Segregation Principle in Ruby using the Car class from the previous examples:

# define an interface for a vehicle
module Vehicle
    def get_make
      raise NotImplementedError, "get_make must be implemented by a subclass"
    end
  
    def get_model
      raise NotImplementedError, "get_model must be implemented by a subclass"
    end
  
    def get_year
      raise NotImplementedError, "get_year must be implemented by a subclass"
    end
  end
  
  # define a class for a car that implements the Vehicle interface
  class Car
    include Vehicle
  
    # define an initialize method to set the starting values for the car's attributes
    def initialize(make, model, year)
      @make = make
      @model = model
      @year = year
    end
  
    # implement the get_make, get_model, and get_year methods of the Vehicle interface
    def get_make
      @make
    end
  
    def get_model
      @model
    end
  
    def get_year
      @year
    end
  end
  
  # define a class for a truck that implements the Vehicle interface
  class Truck
    include Vehicle
  
    # define an initialize method to set the starting values for the truck's attributes
    def initialize(make, model, year, payload)
      @make = make
      @model = model
      @year = year
      @payload = payload
    end
  
    # implement the get_make, get_model, and get_year methods of the Vehicle interface
    def get_make
      @make
    end
  
    def get_model
      @model
    end
  
    def get_year
      @year
    end
  
    # define a method to retrieve the truck's payload
    def get_payload
      @payload
    end
  end
  
  # create an instance of the Car class
  my_car = Car.new("Ford", "Mustang", 1968)
  
  # create an instance of the Truck class
  my_truck = Truck.new("Ford", "F-150", 1971, 1000)
  
  # use the get_make, get_model, and get_year methods of the Vehicle interface to print the make, model, and year of the car
  puts my_car.get_make
  puts my_car.get_model
  puts my_car.get_year
  
  # use the get_make, get_model, and get_year methods of the Vehicle interface to print the make, model, and year of the truck
  puts my_truck.get_make
  puts my_truck.get_model
  puts my_truck.get_year
  
  # use the get_payload method to print the payload of the truck
  puts my_truck.get_payload
  
#   In this code, the Vehicle module defines an interface that specifies the characteristics and behavior that must be implemented by any class that includes the Vehicle module. The Vehicle interface defines three methods: get_make, get_model, and get_year, which are used to retrieve the make, model, and year of a vehicle.

# The Car and Truck classes include the Vehicle module, and therefore must implement the get_make, get_model, and get_year methods of the Vehicle interface. Both classes define their own initialize methods to set the starting values for their attributes, and both implement the get_make, get_model, and get_year methods of the Vehicle interface. This allows the Car and Truck classes to have the same characteristics and behavior as a Vehicle, and to be used in the same way by other classes or methods that expect a Vehicle object.

# The Truck class also defines its own get_payload method, which is specific to trucks and is not part of the Vehicle interface. This allows the Truck class to have additional functionality that is not available to the Car class, without breaking the interface segregation principle. When we call the get_payload method on the my_truck object, it is able to return the payload of the truck, because the Truck class implements this method.

# In real life, the Interface Segregation Principle is used in many different contexts to improve the modularity and scalability of software systems. For example, in a web application, an HttpClient interface may define the methods that are used to send and receive HTTP requests and responses. Different classes, such as a BasicAuthHttpClient class and an OAuth2HttpClient class, may implement the HttpClient interface and provide their own implementations of the methods. This allows the BasicAuthHttpClient and OAuth2HttpClient classes to have the same characteristics and behavior as an HttpClient, but to provide different implementations that are specific to their authentication mechanisms. This makes the code more flexible, maintainable, and testable, and allows the application to support different authentication schemes without breaking the interface segregation principle.
